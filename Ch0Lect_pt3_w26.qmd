## Four-step Modeling Process (C-F-A-U)

::: incremental
1.  **Choose**: Pick a form for the model.

2.  **Fit**: Estimate any parameters.

3.  **Assess**: Is the model adequate? Could it be simpler? Are
    conditions met?

4.  **Use**: Answer the question of interest

### Study: Financial incentives for weight loss

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Research question**: Do financial incentives help people lose
    weight more successfully?

### Two-sample t-test for financial incentives data

**Which model is preferred?**

```{r}
t.test(WeightLoss ~ Group, data = WeightLossIncentive4)
```

## The p-value controversy {background-image="figures/pvalue_controversy.png" background-size="contain" background-position="center"}

## The Trouble with the p-value

::: incremental
-   The $p$-value tells the **strength of evidence** of an "effect"

-   The $p$-value tells nothing about the **size** or **practical
    importance** of an "effect"
:::

## Step 4: Use: Answer the question of interest

::: incremental
-   Confidence interval: estimates the **size** of the effect

-   Scope of inference

    -   Can causal inference be concluded?
    -   To what population(s) can we generalize?
    -   Is the **effect size** large enough to be *important*?
:::

## Effect size {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Effect size**: "an often standardized measure of the magnitude of
    a certain phenomenon of scientific interest."[^1]

-   **Two quantitative variables**

    -   Correlation coefficient $r$

    -   Regression slope (or Beta coefficients or Cohen's $f^2$)

-   **Comparing populations**

    -   Standardized mean difference $\theta$ $$
        \theta = \frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sigma}
        $$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of one (or both) of
        the populations being compared.

:::

##
### Estimated Effect Size for Difference in Means {.smaller}

$$
\mbox{effect size} = \frac{\mbox{Difference in sample means}}{\mbox{Estimated Standard Deviation}} = \frac{\bar y_1-\bar y_2}{s_p}
$$

::: {.fragment}
Where $s_p$ is "pooled" standard deviation defined as: 
$$
s_p=\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}
$$
:::
:::{.fragment}
-   Alternatively, for financial incentives data, we might estimate
    $\sigma$ by $s$, the standard deviation of weight losses for control
    ("untreated") individuals

### Example: Effect Size from Study of Financial Incentives for Weight Loss {.smaller}


```{r}
favstats(WeightLoss ~ Group, data = WeightLossIncentive4)
```

:::{.fragment}
* Using $s_p$ in the denominator:
$\mbox{effect size} = \frac{|\bar y_1 - \bar y_2|}{s_p} =  \frac{|15.68 - 3.92|}{9.25} = 1.27$
:::

:::{.fragment}
* Using $s_C$ (control sd) in the denominator:
$\mbox{effect size} = \frac{|\bar y_1 - \bar y_2|}{s_p} =  \frac{|15.68 - 3.92|}{9.11} = 1.29$
:::

## How to Assess Effect Sizes?

- General guidelines for effect sizes

  - Small: 0.2
  - Medium: 0.5
  - Large: 1.0
  
:::{.fragment}
- But these are no substitute for judgement in context.

  - How does difference in average weight loss of 11.76 pounds compare with starting weights?
  
  - Was weight loss sustained?
:::



## Summary :memo: {.smaller}


* The **C–F–A–U process** guides modeling: choose a model, fit it, assess assumptions, and use it to answer the research question.

* A **p-value** provides evidence of a difference but does not tell us the **magnitude** or **practical importance** of the effect.

* **Effect size** quantifies how large the difference is; in the weight-loss study, the standardized mean difference was **very large**.

* Interpretation always requires **context**: consider generalizability, causality, and whether the effect is meaningful in real-world terms.
