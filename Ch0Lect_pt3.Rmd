# Four-step Modeling Process

1. **Choose**: Pick a form for the model.

--

1. **Fit**: Estimate any parameters.

--

1. **Assess**: Is the model adequate? Could it be simpler? Are conditions met?

--

1. **Use**: Answer the question of interest

# Study: Financial incentives for weight loss

## The p-valaue controversy

---

# The Trouble with the p-value

- The $p$-value tells the strength of evidence of an "effect"

--

- The $p$-value tells nothing about the size or importance of an "effect"


---
# Step 4: Use: Answer the question of interest

- Confidence interval: size of the effect

--

- Scope of inference.  

  - Can causal inference be concluded? 
  - To what population(s) can we generalize? 
  - Is the **effect size** large enough to be *important*? 

---
# Effect size

- **Effect size**: "an often standardized measure of the magnitude of a certain phenomenon of scientific interest."<sup>*</sup>

--

- **Two quantitative variables**

  - Correlation coefficient $r$
  
  - Regression slope $b$ (or Beta coefficients or Cohen's $f^2$)
  
--

-  **Comparing populations**

  - Standardized mean difference $\theta$
$$
\theta = \frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sigma}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of one (or both) of the populations being compared.

# Estimated Effect Size for Difference in Means

$$
\mbox{effect size} = \frac{\mbox{Difference in sample means}}{\mbox{Estimated Standard Deviation}} = \frac{\bar y_1-\bar y_2}{s_p}
$$
Where $s_p$ is "pooled" standard deviation defined as:
$$
s_p=\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}
$$

- Alternatively, for financial incentives data, we might estimate $\sigma$ by $s$, the standard deviation of weight losses for control ("untreated") individuals

# Example: Effect Size from Study of Financial Incentives for Weight Loss


```{r}
favstats(WeightLoss ~ Group, data = WeightLossIncentive4)
```


Using $s_p$ in the denominator:
$$
\mbox{effect size} = \frac{|\bar y_1 - \bar y_2|}{s_p} =  \frac{|15.68 - 3.92|}{9.25} = 1.27
$$
--
Using $s_C$ (control sd) in the denominator:
$$
\mbox{effect size} = \frac{|\bar y_1 - \bar y_2|}{s_p} =  \frac{|15.68 - 3.92|}{9.11} = 1.29
$$

# Assessing Effect Sizes

- General guidelines for effect sizes

  - Small: 0.2
  
  - Medium: 0.5
  
  - Large: 1.0

- But these are no substitute for judgement in context.

  - How does difference in average weight loss of 11.76 pounds compare with starting weights?
  
  - Was weight loss sustained?
